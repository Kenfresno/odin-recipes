        <h1>This roasted chicken recipe is the way my grandmother used to make it. This method results in the juiciest chicken! We loved to nibble on the celery after it was cooked.</h1>
        <p>Roasted chicken never fails to impress, but it's surprisingly simple to make! This juicy roasted chicken recipe is perfect for beginner cooks and old pros alike.</p>
        <p>Roasting a whole chicken at home is easier than it seems. You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> Chicken: This recipe starts with a 3-pound whole chicken. If your bird is larger or smaller, you'll need to adjust the recipe.</li>
            <li>Seasonings: This roasted chicken is simply seasoned with salt, black pepper, and onion powder.</li>
            <li>Butter: Butter (or margarine, if you prefer) locks in moisture and gives the seasonings something to adhere to.</li>
            <li>Celery: Stuff the chicken cavity with celery for subtle vegetal flavor. Plus, the celery will release even more moisture as the chicken cooks.</li>
        </ul>
