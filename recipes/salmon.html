        <p>A simple soy sauce and brown sugar marinade, with hints of lemon and garlic, are the perfect salty-sweet complement to rich salmon fillets.</p>
        <p>Season and marinate the salmon for at least two hours in the refrigerator. Preheat a grill and lightly oil the grate. Place the salmon on the grill and discard the marinade. Cook on each side until the fish flakes easily with a fork. Prepare the following ingredients:</p>

            <li>lemon pepper</li>

            <li>½ cup of water</li>
            <li>¼ cup of vegetable oil</li>
        </ul>
